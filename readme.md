The processor checkpoint 1 implements R and I type instructions from the given MIPS based .s files. 350 Assembler was used to create .mif files. First the design increments the program counter and assigns it back. The instructions fetch and decoding works by negating the bits of the given op code table to result in a correct sequence of 1s and 0s. ALU then handles all the r type instructions and outputs to respective aluOutput variable. Signed operation is executed on I type according to the manual. Overflow is considered. Results are stored in the DMEM
